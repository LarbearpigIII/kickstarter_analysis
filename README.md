# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to determine how different campaigns farred in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Created a pivottable based on the original kickstarter data, then proceded to sort the total count of outcomes based on month and the finished outcome of the campaign. 
After sorting the data, I created a line graph based on the results.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Created a dataset based on the original data comparing the goal amount and the numeric finalized outcome, which was then given a percentage off the total per goal amount set.
With the exceptions of "Below 1000" and "1000 to 4999" the dollar amount was set to $4,999 increments up to $49,999, and anything above $50,000 having its own catagory.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

No major challenges, however this exercise depends greatly on your knowlegdge of using Microsoft Excel or to research solutions.
Excel likes to default to using the time frame in quarters instead of months and I had no idea how to reference different sets in an Excel file.
With a bit of research on both topics, the fixes were not that difficult to implement.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

That the theater campaign is more likely to be successful when launched between April and September.  
Campaign is as likely to fail as well as succeed during when launched during December

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

That the higher your goal correlects negitivity towards success. 
With the exception of goals between $35,000 to $44,999, anything above $19,999 set as a goal, the more likely it is that your campaign will fail.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

If you are just using 2010-2018 data to create a kickstarter with similar goals for 2022, you might miss other information that could be useful in how you would want to crowdfund.
While having 2010-2018 dataset is useful, we could benefit to have the years between 2019 and 2021 to determine trends in the theater catagory.
Also with current events, trends could have been completely altered based on how different media is consumed.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

I would be interested in comparing our current data with data for the theater parent catagory overall, reason is that we could determine if the parent catagory has simular data or if plays are an anomaly.
